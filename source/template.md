### PHP as a Template Engine

Templates must be placed in `templates/` directory (or some other place you set in your `config.php`).

They are just plain PHP script enhanced by [Plates](http://platesphp.com/) library. Thus, you can whatever you can do with PHP.

### Layouts

If you build a certain level of large Web site, you will want to divide templates to multiple files. Layout feature is helpful for such a situation.

Soushi's template system just exploits PHP and Plates library mentioned above. Thus you can build your site with layouts using a feature of Plates.

See [Layouts - Plates](http://platesphp.com/templates/layouts/) for details.

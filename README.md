# Soushi: Bimodal Site Generator Powered by PHP

Soushi (草紙 in Japanese) is a bimodal site generator powered by PHP.

## Concept

In what way is Soushi bimodal?

Soushi is bimodal in terms of that it supports both generating a static Web site for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and serving contents dynamically via PHP scripts which can be simply put onto Web server, making HTML files from source files written in Markdown.

Soushi exploits the strength of PHP which allows us to easily deploy scripts and which is, itself, a template language, being enhanced by [Plates](http://platesphp.com/) library.
